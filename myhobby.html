        <h2>I love to go hiking &#x1F3D6;</h2>
        <p class="justified-text">Hiking is a fantastic way to engage in physical activity and improve my overall fitness. Walking or climbing on trails, navigating uneven terrain, and encountering various challenges along the way contribute to cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and endurance. Near my house, there is a renowned hill called Bukit Belacan that is perfect for hiking. I always hike this hill.</p>
